NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::critic - build your dist and run perl critic
    on the built files.

VERSION
    version 0.001000

DESCRIPTION
    I have a hard time understanding the output of "[Test::PerlCritic]", its
    rather hard to read and is needlessly coated in cruft due to having to
    run through the "Test::" framework.

    It also discards a few preferences from "perlcritic.rc" such as those
    that emit colour codes.

    Again, conflated by the desire to run through the test framework.

    I also don't necessarily want to make the tests pass just to release.

    And I also don't necessarily want to run all the other tests just to
    test critic.

    *TL;DR*

      dzil critic
