Dist::Zilla::App::Command::critic

I have a hard time understanding the output of "[Test::Perl::Critic]",
its rather hard to read and is needlessly coated in cruft due to having
to run through the "Test::" framework.

It also discards a few preferences from "perlcritic.rc" such as those
that emit color codes.

Again, conflated by the need to run through the test framework.

I also don't necessarily want to make the tests pass just to release.

And I also don't necessarily want to run all the other tests just to
test critic.

*TL;DR*

  dzil critic

The result will be similar to doing:

   dzil run --no-build perlcritic -p perlcritic.rc lib/

Except that is useless to me because it doesn't output the file names
anywhere unless you have a verbosity level that incorporates a file name
in *EACH* violation, which for me, is undesirable clutter when you have
20 violations in a single file. ( And the most verbose violation levels,
that is, all except "1,2,3,5,7" lack %f )
