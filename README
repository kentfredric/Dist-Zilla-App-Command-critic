NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::critic - build your dist and run Perl::Critic
    on the built files.

VERSION
    version 0.001002

DESCRIPTION
    I have a hard time understanding the output of "[Test::Perl::Critic]",
    its rather hard to read and is needlessly coated in cruft due to having
    to run through the "Test::" framework.

    It also discards a few preferences from "perlcritic.rc" such as those
    that emit color codes.

    Again, conflated by the need to run through the test framework.

    I also don't necessarily want to make the tests pass just to release.

    And I also don't necessarily want to run all the other tests just to
    test critic.

    *TL;DR*

      dzil critic

      ~ Happyness ~

    The result will be similar to doing:

       dzil run --no-build perlcritic -p perlcritic.rc lib/

    Except that is useless to me because it doesn't output the file names
    anywhere unless you have a verbosity level that incorporates a file name
    in *EACH* violation, which for me, is undesirable clutter when you have
    20 violations in a single file. ( And the most verbose violation levels,
    that is, all except "1,2,3,5,7" lack %f )

CONFIGURATION
    This module has little configuration at this point.

    "perlcritic.rc" is the name of the default profile to use, and it must
    be in your *BUILT* tree to be used.

    Alternatively, *IF* you are using "[Test::Perl::Critic]" in your dist,
    the path specified to "perlcritic.rc" in that module will be used.
